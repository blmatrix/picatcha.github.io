#### **Notes:**

- A unique placement is created at our end for each unique domain (extracted from url) and widget_id combination.

- We update the new values passed through in an hour or so in our database, but we use the updated value for each ad request on real-time basis but it that it’s not write back to database or reflected in our dashboard until after approximately an hour. 

- The array values should be passed as standard URL parameters with multiple key, value pairs. For example, &cat=IAB1&cat=IAB2&cat=IAB3
