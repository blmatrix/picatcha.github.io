      <h1> TERMS AND CONDITIONS </h1>
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions (<b> &#34;Terms&#34;</b>) are entered into by ShinyApps. (<b> &#34;ShinyApps&#34;</b>) and the entity executing an Insertion Order or using the ShinyApps dashboard (<b> &#34;Customer&#34;</b>). These Terms govern Customer&#39;s  use of the ShinyApps service, and together with an Insertion Order (or the information entered through the ShinyApps dashboard (<b> &#34;Dashboard&#34;</b>)) comprise the <b>&#34;Agreement&#34;</b> between ShinyApps and Customer. If there is any inconsistency between: (i) the terms of a signed Insertion Order or those entered through the Dashboard (either <b>&#34;Campaign Details&#34;</b>), and (ii) these Terms, the Campaign Details as applicable, shall prevail.
      </p>

      <h2> 1. Services </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> ShinyApps partners with a network of online properties (the <b>&#34;Network&#34;</b>) and displays a user interface containing links to content that navigate to the websites where such content is maintained (the <b>&#34;Service&#34;</b>). ShinyApps uses its proprietary algorithms to determine what links to Content appear within the Service on the Network. </li>
        <li> ShinyApps shall display links to graphical, textual and/or auditory content selected by Customer (the links and the content accessed from the link together are the <b>&#34;Content&#34;</b>) on the Network through the Service. Customer will only be charged for the number of clicks on Content. Fees will be based on the number of clicks received multiplied by the cost-per-click determined by Customer in the Campaign Details (<b> &#34;CPC&#34;</b>), provided that the CPC may not be less than ShinyApps&#39;s then-in-effect minimum CPC. ShinyApps shall continue to distribute the Content on the Network until the earlier of: (i) the end date, (ii) reaching Customer&#39;s  budget, or (iii) Customer disabling a campaign through the Dashboard, each of (i), (ii) and (iii) as specified by Customer in the Campaign Details (provided that ShinyApps reserves the right to charge for additional clicks as Content is removed from circulation).</li>
        <li> ShinyApps will make reports available to the Customer, which provide information about the number of clicks received during the campaign. The final monthly reports may differ from the daily reports. The final monthly reports will provide the conclusive basis for ShinyApps&#39;s calculation of the fees owed by Customer. Customer may submit its own ShinyApps-compatible click tracker. If there is a 10% discrepancy or more between Customer&#39;s  numbers (based on the ShinyApps-compatible click tracker) and ShinyApps&#39;s numbers then the parties agree to work in good faith to identify the correct amount to be paid to ShinyApps. If the discrepancy is less than 10%, ShinyApps&#39;s numbers shall be conclusive.</li>
        <li> ShinyApps does not guarantee: (i) the placement, positioning or the timing of delivery of any Content, (ii) clicks on any Content, or (iii) conversions. If the Content does not receive clicks amounting to the budget, Customer&#39;s  sole remedies shall be to: (i) extend the end date of the applicable campaign, (ii) replace or add to the Content with other Content (also subject to Section 2 below) to complete the campaign; or (iii) to pay only for actual clicks on the Content. In no event shall ShinyApps be liable for failure to provide clicks.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2> 2. Content</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Customer has the right and authorizes ShinyApps to place the Content on the Network, and is solely responsible for determining the propriety and legality of the Content. In addition, Content selected by Customer must comply with ShinyApps Content Guidelines, as may be updated from time to time by ShinyApps. ShinyApps may at any time for any or no reason reject or remove Content. Customer acknowledges that ShinyApps is not responsible for the Content and that the Content may change during the course of a campaign due to revisions by the Content&#39;s author, comments from readers, or otherwise. Customer&#39;s  recourse in the event of such change shall be to direct ShinyApps to remove such Content from its then-current campaign and/or select other Content. Customer further acknowledges that, if there is an objection from a Content author or publisher, ShinyApps shall cease including the Content in the Service.</li>
        <li> Customer represents and warrants that: (i) if the Content was written by or under the direction of Customer or paid for by Customer, that fact shall be clearly disclosed on or near the Content; (ii) it is authorized to use and/or has approved all words of the Content&#39;s headline (whether written by Customer or on Customer&#39;s  behalf); and (iii) Content headlines accurately reflect the tone and subject matter of the Content.</li>
        <li> Customer shall not, directly or indirectly, provide Content that: (i) is obscene, defamatory, libelous, slanderous, pornographic, violent, profane, indecent or unlawful; (ii) is factually inaccurate, misleading or deceptive; or (iii) facilitates or promotes any type of illegal activity, including without limitation pyramid schemes, gambling, the sale or use of illicit drugs, or discrimination or harassment of any individual or group. Further, each piece of Customer Content shall neither (a) redirect to a destination other than as originally submitted to the Service, and/or (b) be substantively different from the Content originally submitted to the Service.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2> 3. Term and Cancellation </h2>
      <p>
        The Campaign Details will set forth the start and end date of a particular campaign. However, the Agreement, or an individual campaign may be suspended or terminated: (i) by Customer for any reason upon two (2) business days&#39; written notice to ShinyApps or within twelve (12) hours through the Dashboard, or (ii) by ShinyApps for any reason upon thirty days (30) days&#39; written notice to Customer. During the notice period, all previously contracted campaigns shall continue to run pursuant to the Campaign Details and Customer shall be responsible for paying ShinyApps for all clicks received during such notice period. ShinyApps also reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer&#39;s  use of the Service if ShinyApps reasonably believes Customer is in breach of the terms of this Agreement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2> 4.	Campaign Details </h2>
      <p>Customer is solely responsible for all changes requested or approved (either directly or via ShinyApps&#39;s API), including those made through the Dashboard using its login. Customer is solely responsible for protecting its login and password to the Dashboard. Customer can manage campaigns using the Dashboard by modifying the Campaign Details, and/or Customer may have the option of working with an ShinyApps account manager, as determined by ShinyApps.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2> 5.	Fees and Payment Terms </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Customer shall pay ShinyApps fees (based on the number of clicks on the Content, as measured by ShinyApps&#39;s tracking system, multiplied by the CPC) and any applicable taxes. Customer may increase the budget through the Dashboard or through an amendment to an Insertion Order.</li>
        <li> If Customer has signed an Insertion Order, fees will generally be invoiced by ShinyApps to Customer within thirty (30) days of the end of each calendar month for clicks received during the previous month, unless otherwise set forth in an IO. Customer shall pay all invoices within thirty (30) days from receipt. If Customer has provided the Campaign Details through the Dashboard and has not signed an Insertion Order providing for invoicing, ShinyApps shall charge the ShinyApps fees to Customer&#39;s  credit card at such intervals as ShinyApps determines in its sole discretion. The decision as to whether to allow Customer to choose between invoice and credit card rests solely with ShinyApps. ShinyApps shall review all billing inquiries, including refund requests, on a case-by-case basis and reserves the right to approve or deny any request in its sole discretion.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2> 6.	Confidentiality </h2>
